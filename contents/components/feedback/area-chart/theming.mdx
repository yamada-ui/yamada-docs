## Theming

The `AreaChart` is a [single part component](/styled-system/theming/component-style#single-part-components).

:::note
`AreaChart` inherits the style from [LineChart](/components/feedback/line-chart).
:::

:::note
If you want to change the style of the component, please check [here](/styled-system/theming/customize-theme#changing-the-style-of-components).
:::

```ts
export const AreaChart: ComponentMultiStyle = mergeMultiStyle(LineChart, {
  baseStyle: {
    area: {},
  },
})({ omit: ["line"] })
```
