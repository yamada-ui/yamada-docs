## Theming

The `BarChart` is a [single part component](/styled-system/theming/component-style#single-part-components).

:::note
`BarChart` inherits the style from [LineChart](/components/feedback/line-chart).
:::

:::note
If you want to change the style of the component, please check [here](/styled-system/theming/customize-theme#changing-the-style-of-components).
:::

```ts
export const BarChart: ComponentMultiStyle = mergeMultiStyle(LineChart, {
  baseStyle: {
    bar: {},
    activeBar: {},
    background: { fill: "transparent" },
    cursor: { strokeDasharray: "5 5" },
  },
})({ omit: ["dot", "activeDot"] })
```
